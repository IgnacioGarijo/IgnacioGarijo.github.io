abstract: Grade repetition has been widely debated due to its potential negative effects on students' self-esteem and long-term academic performance. While most research has focused on student outcomes, this study shifts the perspective to teachers' decision-making in grade repetition cases. We conduct a survey experiment in Spain, where the repetition rate is significantly higher than the OECD average. Teachers evaluate hypothetical student profiles and decide whether each student should repeat a grade. Our design allows us to analyze the impact of policy exposure, preference alignment, and cognitive biases on teachers' decisions. Additionally, we explore sociodemographic and behavioral factors associated with harsher repetition tendencies, including burnout levels, teaching experience, and institutional characteristics.
